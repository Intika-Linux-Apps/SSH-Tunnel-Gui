---------
* Fixed bug where selecting "Exit" from the tray icon menu does not exit cleanly (now it disconnects any connected sessions and saves configuration changes before exiting)
* Fixed bug where connecting/disconnecting from the main window did not update the connection status icon in the menu
* Added balloon messages when connecting/disconnecting from the menu to provide feedback (this is mainly a test to see if it works)
* The tray icon menu now correctly reflects adding/deleting/changing of sessions

9/2/2005
--------
* Added existing sessions to tray icon menu with the ability to connect/disconnect. Note: adding/deleting/changing sessions currently has no affect on the menu.

9/1/2005
--------
* Hopefully fixed library path separator problem
* Changed behavior when window is reactivated to make it come to the front (and get focus)
* Added some debug logging to troubleshoot random no-op tray icon clicking on linux

8/31/2005
---------
* Started adding a tray icon - window visibility toggles with tray icon clicked or window minimized

8/14/2005
---------
* Added JGoodies Looks to classpath and ability to set theme (for example, -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticXPLookAndFeel -Dplastic.defaulttheme=com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.theme.SkyBluerTahoma)
* Hopefully fixed session panel header size problem by setting the first column (status column) capion to a space
* Added "Save Password?" option to session and prompt when connecting if password is missing
* Changed add/edit session and tunnel dialogs to be not resizable
* Changed behavior after editing an existing session or tunnel to simply repaint the grid so focus is not lost
* Added remote forward capability (the underlying library appears to be broken when it comes to stopping remote forwards)
* Added known hosts key verification
